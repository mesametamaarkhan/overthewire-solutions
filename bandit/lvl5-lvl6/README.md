# Bandit Level 5 → Level 6

The goal of this level is to find a file inside the `inhere` directory that is **1033 bytes in size** and **not executable**. This file contains the password for the next level.

---

**Connection Details:**
- Host: `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
- Port: `2220`
- Username: `bandit5`
- Password: (from previous level)

---

**Commands Used:**

```bash
ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
cd inhere
ls -la
find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable
cat ./maybehere07/.file2
````

> The `find` command searches for:
>
> * `-type f`: regular files
> * `-size 1033c`: exactly 1033 bytes
> * `! -executable`: files that are **not executable**

---

**Output:**

The matching file contains the password for Bandit Level 6:

```text
REDACTED
```

---

**What I Learned:**

* Using `find` with specific conditions (size, type, executable status)
* Interpreting file permissions with `ls -la`
* Navigating hidden files and nested directories
* Precise file filtering using `find` in C-style byte units (`c` = bytes)

---

**Next Connection:**

Use the password above to connect to the next level:

```bash
ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
