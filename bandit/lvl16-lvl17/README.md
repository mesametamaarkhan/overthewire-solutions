Great job navigating a tricky level! Here's a detailed and polished `README.md` for **Bandit Level 16 ‚Üí Level 17**, capturing your full workflow including port scanning, SSL interaction, and SSH key handling:

# Bandit Level 16 ‚Üí Level 17

In this level, the password is not given directly. Instead, you're required to scan local ports to find a service offering an SSH private key. Once found, you must extract and save that key locally, then use it to log in as `bandit17`.

---

**Connection Details:**
- Host: `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
- Port: `2220`
- Username: `bandit16`
- Password: (from previous level)

---

### üîç Steps Taken:

```bash
# Connect to bandit16
ssh bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

# (Optional) View the password if needed
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit16

# Scan for open ports between 31000‚Äì32000
nmap localhost -p 31000-32000
````

This reveals a few open ports. To determine which one uses SSL and serves the SSH key:

```bash
# Check for SSL services (only try those with SSL)
openssl s_client -connect localhost:<PORT>
```

If the service responds with a certificate and you see an SSH private key or a prompt, try:

```bash
ncat --ssl localhost <PORT>
```

Enter the password for `bandit16` when prompted. If correct, the server returns an **SSH private key** for `bandit17`.

---

### üîë Handling the SSH Key:

1. Exit back to your local machine or a shell with SSH access.
2. Save the SSH key securely:

```bash
vim bandit17.key
# Paste the SSH key here
```

3. Set proper permissions:

```bash
chmod 600 bandit17.key
```

4. Use it to SSH into the next level:

```bash
ssh -i bandit17.key bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

---

**What I Learned:**

* Scanning ports using `nmap`
* Identifying SSL-enabled services with `openssl s_client`
* Securely handling and using SSH keys
* Combining multiple tools (nmap, ncat, openssl, ssh) to solve a layered challenge

---

**Next Connection:**

Once authenticated with the SSH key, you‚Äôll be logged in as `bandit17` and ready for the next level:

```bash
ssh -i bandit17.key bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
