Perfect! Here's the complete `README.md` for **Bandit Level 9 → Level 10**, based on the steps you followed:

# Bandit Level 9 → Level 10

The goal of this level is to extract the password from a file named `data.txt`. The password is hidden among other data, but is identifiable by a specific pattern — it contains an equals sign (`=`), suggesting it's encoded or formatted uniquely.

---

**Connection Details:**
- Host: `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
- Port: `2220`
- Username: `bandit9`
- Password: (from previous level)

---

**Commands Used:**

```bash
ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
ls -la
strings data.txt | grep "="
````

> * `strings` pulls out all printable strings from the file (useful for binary or noisy data).
> * `grep "="` filters to show only lines that contain an equals sign, where the password is embedded.

---

**Output:**

The output includes a line like:

```text
XXXXXXXXX=
```

That line is the password for Bandit Level 10:

```text
REDACTED
```

---

**What I Learned:**

* Further use of `strings` to extract human-readable data from binary files
* How to filter output based on identifiable patterns (like `=`)
* Recognizing signs of encoded strings (e.g., base64 often ends with `=`)

---

**Next Connection:**

Use the password above to connect to the next level:

```bash
ssh bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
