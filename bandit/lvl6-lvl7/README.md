# Bandit Level 6 → Level 7

The goal of this level is to find a file somewhere on the system that meets **all** of the following conditions:
- Owned by user: `bandit7`
- Owned by group: `bandit6`
- Exactly 33 bytes in size

This file contains the password for the next level.

---

**Connection Details:**
- Host: `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
- Port: `2220`
- Username: `bandit6`
- Password: (from previous level)

---

**Commands Used:**

```bash
ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
ls -la
find / -type f -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null
````

> `2>/dev/null` is used to suppress permission-denied errors from directories the current user can't access.

After locating the correct file path in the output, run:

```bash
cat /path/to/the/file
```

For example:

```bash
cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
```

---

**Output:**

The file contains the password for Bandit Level 7:

```text
REDACTED
```

---

**What I Learned:**

* How to use `find` to search the entire filesystem
* Filtering by exact file size with `-size 33c`
* Filtering by owner and group using `-user` and `-group`
* Suppressing error output with `2>/dev/null` for cleaner results

---

**Next Connection:**

Use the password above to connect to the next level:

```bash
ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

```
